## Mission

**SnathAI** is built on a fundamental belief: modern AI systems should not be opaque, unpredictable, or impossible to audit. They should be **Glass-Box** systems—reliable, inspectable, and engineered with the same rigor expected from enterprise software.

We provide the architectural primitives to build agents where every step, mutation, and decision is traceable, deterministic, and verifiable.

## The Ecosystem

### Core Engine
| Project | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **[Lár Engine](https://github.com/snath-ai/lar)** | The lightweight, deterministic execution engine powering all SnathAI agents. Designed as the "PyTorch for Agents," it prioritizes explicit control flow and complete auditability over "magic" abstractions. |


### Demonstrations
Explore practical, production-ready applications of the Lár Engine:

| Demo | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **[RAG Pipeline](https://github.com/snath-ai/rag-demo)** | A transparent Retrieval-Augmented Generation pipeline featuring FAISS retrieval, critique-improve loops, and deterministic error handling. |
| **[Customer Support](https://github.com/snath-ai/customer-support-demo)** | A multi-agent orchestration system where a Triage Agent delegates tasks to specialized Billing and Technical Support agents. |
| **[Code Repair](https://github.com/snath-ai/code-repair-demo)** | An automated CI/CD bot that detects, analyzes, and repairs code issues using a deterministic workflow. |

---

## Quick Start

Install the core engine to begin building deterministic agents:

```bash
pip install lar-engine
```

Refer to our [Getting Started Guide](https://docs.snath.ai/getting-started/) to build your first auditable agent in minutes.
