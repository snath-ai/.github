## 🚀 Mission

**SnathAI™** is built on a simple belief: modern AI systems should not be opaque, unpredictable, or impossible to audit. They should be **Glass-Box** systems—reliable, inspectable, and engineered with the same rigor expected from production‑grade software.

We provide the tools to build agents where every step, mutation, and decision is traceable.
