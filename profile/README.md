## The Platform

**SnathAI** builds the infrastructure for **Glass-Box Artificial Intelligence**. We enable enterprises to deploy autonomous agents that are deterministic, auditable, and compliant with rigorous standards like **FDA 21 CFR Part 11**.

### Open Source
| Component | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **[Lár Engine](https://github.com/snath-ai/lar)** | The "Flight Recorder" for AI Agents. A deterministic graph engine that logs every state change, decision, and cost. Free and Open Source. |

### Enterprise
| Component | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **[Snath Enterprise](https://snath.ai/enterprise)** | **"The Bunker"**. A self-hosted, air-gapped platform giving you a specialized runtime with **HMAC-Signed Audit Trails**, **Kubernetes Orchestration**, and **Validation Packs**. |
| **[Snath Cloud](https://snath.ai/cloud)** | **"The Hive"**. Managed serverless infrastructure for deploying and scaling millions of agent executions without ops overhead. |

## Why SnathAI?

Most agent frameworks are **Black Boxes**—great for demos, impossible to debug in production. We solve the **"Black Box Tax"** by focusing on:

1.  **Deterministic Control**: No "magic" loops. You define the graph; we run it exactly as specified.
2.  **Forensic Audibility**: Every token, every tool call, and every error is logged to an immutable ledger.
3.  **Regulatory Alignment**: Architecture designed from day one for regulated industries (Healthcare, Finance, Defense).
