# Introduction

Snath.ai™ is built on a simple belief: modern AI systems should not be opaque, unpredictable, or impossible to audit. They should be reliable, inspectable, and engineered with the same rigor expected from production‑grade software systems.

To achieve this, Snath.ai™ introduces the **Lár Engine**, a minimal and deterministic execution engine for building and orchestrating AI agents and pipelines. Lár provides full transparency into the execution process, enabling developers to deploy AI systems that behave consistently and can be traced and audited in detail.

# The Problem: Black‑Box AI

Most current agent frameworks operate as black boxes. When failures occur, debugging becomes guesswork and system reliability suffers. The lack of visibility makes it difficult for engineering teams to trust these frameworks in critical production environments.

Snath.ai™ aims to solve this by providing a **glass‑box alternative**—a framework where every step, mutation, and decision is traceable.

# The Lár Engine (Open Source)


Lár is the lightweight, open‑source engine that powers all Snath.ai™ agents. It embraces a deterministic, define‑by‑run design philosophy that emphasizes clarity and reliability.

## Key Characteristics

- **Deterministic Execution**  
  Each node executes sequentially with predictable behavior.

- **Define‑by‑Run Orchestration**  
  No hidden abstractions. The execution flow is explicit and controlled.

- **Structured State Logging**  
  Every mutation and step is recorded, enabling complete audit trails.

- **Minimal and Composable Primitives**  
  Inspired by the simplicity and transparency of libraries like PyTorch.

## Installation

```
pip install lar-engine
```

# Demonstration Applications

Snath.ai™ provides a set of demonstration applications that showcase the practical capabilities of the Lár Engine.

### Retrieval‑Augmented Generation (RAG) Demonstration  
A fully transparent RAG pipeline featuring FAISS retrieval, a critique‑improve loop, and consistent, repeatable execution.

### Multi‑Agent Customer Support Demonstration  
An orchestrated multi‑agent system where a Triage Agent delegates tasks to specialized Billing and Technical Support agents.

These demonstrations highlight how deterministic orchestration improves reliability and debugging.

# Snath.ai™ Platform (Commercial)

The Snath.ai™ commercial platform extends the open‑source Lár Engine with enterprise‑grade capabilities for deployment, monitoring, and operational management of agent‑based systems.

## Platform Components

- **Multi‑Tenant Dashboard**  
  Centralized management of agent workflows across teams and organizations.

- **End‑to‑End Auditing**  
  Access complete, structured "flight logs" for every agent execution.

- **Real‑Time Monitoring**  
  Track execution performance and system health.

- **Production‑Ready Orchestration**  
  Scalable infrastructure built to support thousands of concurrent agent tasks.

# Vision

Snath.ai™ aims to become the industry standard for transparent, deterministic, and production‑focused AI systems.  
By eliminating black‑box abstractions, we enable developers to build systems they can understand, verify, and trust.
